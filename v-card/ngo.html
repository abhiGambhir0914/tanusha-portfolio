                                        Education is fundamental to an equitable society. An excellent education equips children and youth with the knowledge, skills, values, and mindsets needed to be empowered individuals and responsible citizens. The fact that a high-quality education has wide-ranging benefits for individuals and societies has been demonstrated, time and again, by countries across the world. The truth is that today, more than 50% of students in Grade 5 cannot read a Grade 2 text or solve a simple subtraction problem. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Steps were taken by the government to ensure literacy in India, but its lack of knowledge and implementation at the ground level results in a low literacy rate and difficulty to provide education to the slum children.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3 class="title title--h3">Lack of Knowledge About ECCE (Early Child Care Education)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                            While both the National Policy on Education (1986 & 1992) and the RTE (2009) (Sec 11) recognizes the importance of ECCE, the RTE guarantees free and compulsory education to children 
                                            only in the age-group of 6-14 years. In fact, although India has one of the largest welfare schemes for ECCE in the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program, it 
                                            faces multiple challenges ranging from access to quality. Lack of monitoring of services delivered by the Anganwadi centers, along with limited training of workers on nutrition 
                                            and pre-school education, has resulted in a situation that is extremely alarming, with a large number of children under 6 missing out on early child care.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3 class="title title--h3">Development of Teachers</h3>
                                    <p>
                                            Building capability in teachers has been a major challenge with pre-service and in-service teacher training falling short of equipping our teachers with the skills and mindsets 
                                            required to succeed in a diverse range of classroom and school contexts. 
                                            In addition, the country faces a shortage of over 9 lakh teachers and qualified headteachers who can lead a school. These conditions are exacerbated by a poor culture, 
                                            influenced by social perceptions around teaching, which further lessens the motivation of high-quality aspirants from entering the profession. Add to that a low-quality 
                                            education for teacher aspirants, and we end up with the depressing statistic of 83% failure rate in the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) in 2015.
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <h3 class="title title--h3">RTE and Its Lack of Implementation</h3>
                                    <p>
                                            To this effect, Section 21 of the RTE Act (2009) mandates the formation of School Management Committees (SMCs) in all 
                                            government-run or aided schools. SMCs are responsible for monitoring school functioning and finances, and for creating School 
                                            Development Plans (SDPs). With an eye on equitable decision-making, parents or guardians are supposed to make up 75% of the 
                                            committee, with proportional representation for disadvantaged groups and 50% representation by women. However, a high incidence of 
                                            illiteracy, lack of awareness of rights, roles, and responsibilities, and prevailing power structures often interfere with the proper 
                                            functioning of SMCs. In fact, while DISE Data suggests that 91% of schools in India have 
                                            instituted SMCs, only two-thirds have received any form of training, and 40% are not even involved in the preparation of the SDP, much less implement it.
                                    </p>
